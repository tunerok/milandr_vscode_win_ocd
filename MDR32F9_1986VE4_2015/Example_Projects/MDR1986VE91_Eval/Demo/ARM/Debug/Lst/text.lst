N    /*
N     * Copies or moves a piece of memory from one place to another,
N     * with one-bit granularity. So you can start or finish a copy
N     * part way through a byte, and you can copy between regions
N     * with different alignment within a byte.
N     * 
N     * All these functions have the same prototype: two void *
N     * pointers for destination and source, then two integers
N     * giving the bit offset from those pointers, and finally the
N     * number of bits to copy.
N     * 
N     * Just like memcpy and memmove, the "cpy" functions copy as
N     * fast as they can in the assumption that the memory regions
N     * do not overlap, while the "move" functions cope correctly
N     * with overlap.
N     *
N     * Treating memory as a stream of individual bits requires
N     * defining a convention about what order those bits are
N     * considered to be arranged in. The above functions support
N     * multiple conventions:
N     * 
N     *  - the "bl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion, so that the LSB comes
N     *    first. (For example, membitcpybl(a,b,0,7,1) would copy
N     *    the MSB of the byte at b to the LSB of the byte at a.)
N     * 
N     *  - the "bb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion, so that the MSB comes
N     *    first.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in big-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion.

N/**
N * @mainpage MDR32F9Qx Standard Peripherals Library.
N * MDR32F9Qx Standard Peripherals Library is a package consisting of
N * all standard peripheral device drivers for 1986BE9x, K1986BE9x, MDR32F9Qx
N * and 1986VE1T microcontrollers.
N * This library is a firmware package which contains a collection of routines,
N * data structures and macros covering the features of Milandr MDR32F9Qx
N * peripherals. It includes a description of the device drivers plus a set of
N * examples for each peripheral. The firmware library allows any device to be
N * used in the user application without the need for in-depth study of each
N * peripherals specifications. Using the Standard Peripherals Library has two
N * advantages: it saves significant time that would otherwise be spent in
N * coding, while simultaneously reducing application development and
N * integration costs.
N *
N * The MDR32F9Qx Standard Peripherals Library is compatible with Milandr
N * 1986BE9x evaluation boards and Milandr evaluation board for MC 1986VE1T
N * (EVAL 22.0 B).
N *
N * The MDR32F9Qx Standard Peripherals Library is full CMSIS compliant.
